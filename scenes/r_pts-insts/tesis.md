# Easy GLSL-compute prototyping art in TouchDesigner and porting it to WebGL (Physarum feedback example).
https://dearwhoever.space/physarum.test/

## WebGL problems and caveats to solve.
- simulate compute shaders \w buffer swapping
- no color buffers
- no lod
- only halffloat on mobiles
- frequently calling opengl bindings, its slow
- why not webgpu? soon capabilities, no tools yet


- why we cant calc it in one shader? why instancing
Simple abstractions, extending ThreeJS primitives, to reach flexible data flow.
What is Shadertoy and how to get it by yourself + instancing and 3D features.
Presets and 1-string rich GUI for any shader material.
+ if there is time left:
Affecting with HTML blocks.
Affecting with native low latency mic analyzing.
